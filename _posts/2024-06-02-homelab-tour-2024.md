## Logical Network Diagram
Having a diagram of the local network helps visualize what is where and everything is connected.

## HomeCloud Server
* ASUS Prime B560M-A LGA 
* MSI Geforce RTX-2060
* Intel i5-11600K: The 11th gen K was important for the onboard igpu to use for Plex transcoding or other light graphics work. The K was important for virtualization.
* 2X Corsair Vengence 16GB DDR4 Memory: Will update soon.
* Rosewill 4U Server Chassis 9 Bay Server
#### Storage
* SEAGATE Skyhawk 4TB Surveillance Drive

* and about a 1000' of ethernet cable
## Services Used
#### Dashboards
* ***Grafana** great visualization tool for network activity and server stats including power consumption. [unPoller](https://unpoller.com/) is used to retrieve information about the Ubiquity devices including client insights, AP insights, network insights, and USG insight. unRaid server stats are also displayed providing insight into VMs usage, memory allocation, CPU usage, disk space, docker containers, etc.
* ***HomePage** provides a great default window for all new browser windows. Quick glance at relatives stats for each service running, server statistics, and bookmarks to common websites internal and external.

#### Home Security
Cameras:
* Reolink Duo 2
* Reolink RLC-810A
* Reolink RLC-820A
NVR and Detection:
* [Frigate](https://frigate.video/)
* [Deepstack AI](https://www.deepstack.ai/)
* [Doubletake](https://github.com/jakowenko/double-take)
Hardware:
* SEAGATE Skyhawk 4TB Surveillance Drive
* Google Coral TPU

#### Network Management & Access
* Traefik
* Authelia: Need to set up two factor
* L2TP VPN: hosted on UPD, but needs to upgraded to Teleport or Wireguard due to depreciation. Also consider [unifi-ddns](https://github.com/willswire/unifi-ddns)for Cloudflare DDNS support
* Wireguard: unRaid hosted
* Cloudflare DDNS Tunnel: Temp disabled since I don't want to rely on cloud based services

#### Monitoring
* Uptime Kuma
* unRaid-API
* Glances
* Telegraf
* Portainer
* unPoller
* Dozzle
* *iPerf*

#### DBs
* InfluxDB & InfluxDB2: unPoller requires legacy InfluxDB 1.x. HassIO and NutServer both use InfluxDB2
* MariaDB: 
* Redis: Used for for Authelia session data.


#### WebDev
* GitTea
* Bookstack: random documentation for cars, home items, thoughts, etc
* WordPress: A couple projects for clients
* Obsidian: MD file based note taking. Where I wrote this post!
* Jekyll: static website generator. How I built this site!

#### DNS
* PiHole
* Cloudflare
* Unbound

#### Media Processing
* Plex
* Ombi
* Tautulli 
* Radarr: Two instances; one for SD/HD/UHD and another for remux
* Sonarr
* TDARR: distributed transcoding system
* Wizarr: user onboarding UI
* YoutubeDL
* Notifiarr

#### Tools
* Binhex
* Adminer
* Whoami: used as simple heart beat for remote UptimeKuma on Digital Ocean
* iCloudSync: used primarily for icloud backup as well as Obsidian Note to Jekyll pipeline
### VMs
* **Windows 11**: primarily used as gaming machine, which is rarely used, but fun to have. Paired with the RTX-2060, I am able to stream all games to both NVIDIA Shield Pros in the house using [Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org/)
* **HASSIO**: [Home Assistant OS](https://www.home-assistant.io/)  Amazing open source home automation platform that enables all connected devices to be monitored or controlled through user built dashboards and automations.
* **Ubuntu Desktop**: Main OS for desktop directly wired from HomeCloud through the walls and crawlspace to my office desk. Great for distraction free development.
* **Ubuntu Servers**: Used primarily as test environments for CI/CD deployments or emulating production environments.
